## **The BackEnd**

Build an app that handles the process of creating an order for a retailer company. This app consist of a series of endpoints, the information is as follows.

We have 4 separate entities that connect to each other: users, orders, shipping, and payments, each one has to save information about the domain of each table.

The above description does not include relations or conditionals between tables, you have to design the database yourself. You should use MySQL for your database.

The required outgoing end points are (well just a single endpoint "orders" with multiple options and the login endpoint to get the login token):

**login** here you send username and password in order to obtain a token to keep working with the other endpoint.

**orders/#orderid** - pass the order ID and get the formatted JSON with the required information.

**orders/[order_ids]** - pass multiple order IDs in string format, separated by comma (,) and return the info of those orders.

**orders/date-start - date-end** - pass two dates and return the ids of the orders between those dates

**orders/shipping/{key=string}** return all orders with the given key (city, state, country) and string as value.

**orders/user_id** return orders from that specific user.

**users/all** list all users basic info

**users/user_id** list the user info from the given user id

**orders/search term -** search for the term given in multiple parts of the order, and return the results

Ordering is received as a parameter, but ordering must be done in the code (not in the queries). And use the standard ordering and searching algorithms.

You are responsible for also building the endpoint that will save all the information for a new user and a new order (quick tip, shipping and payment must have an order, users are independent)

You should document your architecture selection in the README the reasons and why that architecture fits your project. (You are free to use any architecture or patterns you want)

For this you are limited to use:

-   Python (Django, Flask, Django rest framework or Fast API)
-   MySQL or Postgres.
-   You must implement and follow TDD.

## **Front End**

You will build a front end for your Rest API, you can use React, Vue, Angular or plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Recommended the later). The design is up to you, but should allow us to see all the above endpoints. This should be a separate project and repository.

You have to include 4 views.

-   Login, to get the token a login into the system
-   Search: here you have a search box, filters and links, order by, etc.
-   Orders list. (result from previous search, could be the same view)
-   Order details (for when you select an order)
-   User Details

## **DevOps.**

Your projects should be easily deployed and integrated to one of the major vendors (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Heroku) And the configuration files should be included in the repository.

Your system should integrate basic CD (Continuous Deployment), deployment can be done automatically from GitHub or GitLab to your cloud vendor.

**Extra points if:**

-   You design your product, so it can reduce or eliminate variability. This means it should be consistent in various cases. (If you need help read a bit before attempting the task) A quick definition that will help greatly ([](https://wise.vub.ac.be/topic/software-variability)[https://wise.vub.ac.be/topic/software-variability](https://wise.vub.ac.be/topic/software-variability))

You are allowed to use any extra tool like Postman, Jenkins, SonarQube, etc.

**Gotchas**

-   One order can have multiple payments
-   The paid field in the order is boolean.
-   The order information is not the same as the saved, some values need to be calculated.

**Expected output for an order includes**

-   order_id
-   customer_id
-   customer_name
-   gov_id
-   order_date
-   last_payment_date
-   order status
-   shipping_info
-   totals
-   user_information

It Is up to you to build this JSON object correctly.

gov_id stands for government issued ID (so it's alphanumeric)
